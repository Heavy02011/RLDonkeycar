Approach 1:

Need to change to 1-hot categorical
Need to store / predict reward

does multi-param stop working?
does 1-hot stop working?

train on 1-hot 
  - reward self-training won't work, but that's OK for debugging
  - see if we get reasonable results going around track
  - see if switch to NN continues to work

Add reward prediciton
  - see if switch to NN continues to work

-----------------
Approach 2:

Predict 3 numbers
  - throttle, steer, reward

Only train if reward improves upon predicted-reward?
won't choose max reward
